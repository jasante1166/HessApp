## ðŸ©º Introduction

The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the healthcare sector is accelerating globally. In developing countries, mobile technology is increasingly being used to bridge gaps in healthcare delivery, especially in remote or underserved areas. With the widespread coverage of mobile networks and the surge in smartphone usage, there is a growing demand for mobile applications that improve emergency response and healthcare communication.

HessApp is developed in response to this need, offering a user-friendly platform to connect patients, bystanders, and healthcare facilities during critical moments. It forms part of a larger vision to support real-time data flow, patient monitoring, and emergency decision-making using smart mobile devices.

## ðŸ“š Background of the Study

Medical emergencies are an unavoidable part of human life, and timely response can often make the difference between life and death. In many cases, people around the victim may be able and willing to help, but lack the tools or information to do so effectively.

HessApp is a mobile-based solution developed to address this challenge by providing:
- A direct line of support to healthcare facilities.
- Real-time alerts and data sharing during emergencies.
- Access to patient records and critical information to support diagnosis and intervention.
- A platform for hospitals to manage emergency cases more efficiently.

This app empowers both the public and healthcare providers to respond quickly, reducing the burden on hospitals while improving patient outcomes.
